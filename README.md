This is the default theme for the [Pybossa
server](https://github.com/PyBossa/pybossa).

![Shuttleworth Foundation Funded](http://pybossa.com/assets/img/shuttleworth-funded.png)

PyBossa was inspired by the [BOSSA](http://bossa.berkeley.edu/) crowdsourcing engine but is written in
python (hence the name!). It can be used for any distributed tasks project
but was initially developed to help scientists and other researchers
crowd-source human problem-solving skills!

# See it in Action
