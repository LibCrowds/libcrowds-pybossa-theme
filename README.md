This is the British Library theme for the crowdsourcing platform based on [Pybossa
](https://github.com/PyBossa/pybossa).

![Shuttleworth Foundation Funded](http://pybossa.com/assets/img/shuttleworth-funded.png)

PyBossa was inspired by the [BOSSA](http://bossa.berkeley.edu/) crowdsourcing engine but is written in
python (hence the name!). It can be used for any distributed tasks project
but was initially developed to help scientists and other researchers
crowd-source human problem-solving skills!
