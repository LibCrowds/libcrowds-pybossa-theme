=======================================
Welcome to the PyBossa.js Documentation
=======================================

PyBossa.JS is an open source library for the `PyBossa <http://docs.pybossa.com>`_ 
crowd-sourcing framework. PyBossa is designed to distribute tasks that require 
human cognition, knowledge or intelligence (e.g. image classification, 
transcription, information location etc).

PyBossa.JS simplifies the access to the PyBossa API providing several public
methods that will get and submit a task for a given project in PyBossa.

User Guide
==========

This section covers how to use PyBossa.JS from the perspective of a PyBossa
end-user such as:

  * Creators and managers of a specific PyBossa microtasking project:
    getting a task and saving the answer from the volunteers in the data base.
    
We suggest starting by taking a quick look at the overview of the `PyBossa <http://docs.pybossa.com>`_
system as this will introduce you to a few pieces of terminology and help you
understand how things fit together.
