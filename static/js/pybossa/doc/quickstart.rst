==========
Quickstart
==========

The library is provided with the PyBossa server. However, the source code and
unit tests for PyBossa.JS are included in a different repository and
distributed as a git submodule for PyBossa.

If you are creating a new PyBossa project, you will get the library loaded
for you, so you only need to start using it (check the demo
projects)[https://github.com/PyBossa/]::

   <script src=/static/js/pybossa/pybossa.js>

You can get the source code cloning/forking the repository::

  git clone https://github.com/PyBossa/pybossa.js/

Or download the ZIP file from this URL::
