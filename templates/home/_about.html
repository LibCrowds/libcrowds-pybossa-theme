                <p>{{ brand }} is a crowd-sourcing platform with the ultimate goal of making important research material available
                and accessible to a wider audience.</p>
                    
                <p>Each project contains a collection of tasks related to a specific area of research. These are tasks that can be
                accurately processed by computers, they require human intelligence. Each individual task can usually be completed quickly,
                yet the collections of tasks are often vast. Therefore, the only feasible way to complete such a number of tasks
                within a reasonable length of time is via widespread user contributions.</p>
                    
                <p>By participating you will have a direct impact on the availability of research material to anyone interested in
                the diverse collections available at the British Library. Records matched, located, transcribed or translated as part of
                one of our crowd-sourcing projects will be uploaded to the British Library's catalogues. These catalogues
                are free for anyone to search online in their entirety.</p>
