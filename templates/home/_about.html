                <p class="lead">While the British Library is relatively young for a national library, its history stretches back until
                long before computers were used for cataloguing as standard. The library's online database,
                <a href="http://explore.bl.uk/" target="_blank">Explore</a>, provides public access to nearly 57 million records.
                However, there are many important research items that can currently only be found by searching...</p>
                
                <p class="lead">Blah, blah, blah...this section will be updated soon with something more specific to the card catalogues :)</p>
                    
                <p>Each project contains a collection of tasks related to a specific area of research. These are tasks that can be
                accurately processed by computers, they require human intelligence. Each individual task can usually be completed quickly,
                yet the collections of tasks are often vast. Therefore, the only feasible way to complete such a number of tasks
                within a reasonable length of time is via widespread user contributions.</p>
                    
                <p>By participating you will have a direct impact on the availability of research material to anyone interested in
                the diverse collections available at the British Library. Records matched, located, transcribed or translated as part of
                one of our crowd-sourcing projects will be uploaded to the British Library's catalogues. These catalogues
                are free for anyone to search online in their entirety.</p>
