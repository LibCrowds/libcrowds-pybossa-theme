                <h2>Featured Project: Convert-a-Card</h2>
			
                In our first project series, Convert-a-Card, we're experimenting with a new method for transforming printed card catalogues into electronic records for inclusion in our online catalogue <a href="http://explore.bl.uk/">Explore</a>.</p>
                
                <p>While the <a href="http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/quickinfo/facts/history/" target="_blank">British Library</a> is relatively young for a national library, 
                much of its vast historical collections were acquired long before computers were used for cataloguing as standard. So, while the library's online catalogue, 
                <a href="http://explore.bl.uk/" target="_blank">Explore</a>, provides public access to nearly 57 million records,
                there are still thousands of important research items that can only be found by searching the old physical card catalogues.</p>
                                                                           
                <p>Records matched, located, transcribed or translated as part of Convert-a-Card will be uploaded to the
                <a href="http://explore.bl.uk/" target="_blank">British Library's Explore catalogue</a> for anyone to search online. By participating you will have a direct impact
                on the availability of research material to anyone interested in the diverse collections available at the British Library. </p>
